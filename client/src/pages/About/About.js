						Buskr provides a platform for musicians to showcase their songs to
						music fans who are interested in breaking free from the global
						trendscape in order to discover local acts performing nearby. 
						<br />
						<br />
						Have a particular musical style or genre in mind? Filter creators
						by vibe to zero in on your next favorite artist.
						<br />
						<br />
						Once you've found a sound you resonate with, consider donating a
						few dollars to that creator right there on their profile. It's the
						next best thing to dropping a dollar in a guitar case on a street
						corner, especially at a time when we're seldomly out and about.
